# Cancer_Website

The project's goal is to create an easily navigable cancer information website by 
employing data visualization techniques to display extensive datasets. Organizing 
various data kinds, creating powerful visuals, and making sure users are informed 
and engaged.

<br/>

## Datasets Used :
- [Cancer Statistics 2020 India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejasurya/cancer-data-india) <br/>
- [Cancer death rate by age group 1990 - 2019](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-age?tab=table) <br/>
- [Cancer death by type 1990 - 2019](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-cancer-deaths-by-type?tab=table)  <br/>
- [Demographics Website Reference](https://gco.iarc.fr/today/en) <br/>

<br/>

## Technologies Used :
- HTML/CSS <br/>
*HTML (HyperText Markup Language)*:
HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
It provides the structure of a webpage by using a series of elements or tags.
Each element has an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.<br/>
*CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)*:
CSS is used to style and layout web pages.
It describes how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
CSS can be applied inline, internally within an HTML document, or externally via an external stylesheet.
<br/>

- NodeJS <br/>
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling the creation of scalable and high-performance network applications.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules managed via npm (Node Package Manager).
<br/>

- PowerBI  <br/>
Power BI is a business analytics tool developed by Microsoft. It provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.</br>
