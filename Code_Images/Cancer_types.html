            <h2  text-align: center >Breast Cancer</h2>
            <p>
                Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cells of the breast tissue. 
                It can occur in both men and women, although it is much more common in women. 
                Breast cancer typically begins as a lump or abnormal growth in the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by symptoms such as changes in breast size or shape, nipple discharge, or skin changes. 
                
            </p>
            <p><br/>
                Early detection through screening methods such as mammograms increases the chances of successful treatment. 
                Treatment options for breast cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the type and stage of the cancer. 
                Regular self-examinations and awareness of risk factors such as family history, age, hormonal factors, and lifestyle choices are important in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer.

            <h2  text-align: center >Lung Cancer</h2>
            <p>
                Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs and can spread to other parts of the body. 
                It is primarily caused by smoking cigarettes, but can also be linked to exposure to secondhand smoke, environmental toxins, and genetic factors. 
                Lung cancer often does not cause symptoms in its early stages, making it difficult to detect. 
            </p>
            <p><br/>
                However, as the disease progresses, symptoms such as persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing up blood, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss may develop. 
                Treatment options for lung cancer depend on the type of cancer, its stage, and the patient's overall health, but may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.
                Early detection through screening programs can improve the chances of successful treatment and survival. 
                Smoking cessation and avoidance of secondhand smoke are important in preventing lung cancer.

            <h2  text-align: center >Ovarian Cancer</h2>
            <p>
                Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries, the female reproductive organs responsible for producing eggs and hormones. 
                It is often referred to as the "silent killer" because it may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. 
                However, as the disease progresses, symptoms such as abdominal bloating or swelling, pelvic pain or pressure, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary symptoms (urgency or frequency), and changes in bowel habits may develop. 
                Risk factors for ovarian cancer include age, family history of ovarian or breast cancer, inherited genetic mutations (BRCA1 and BRCA2), and certain reproductive factors (e.g., never giving birth, infertility, early menstruation, or late menopause). 
                
            </p>
            <p><br/>
                Treatment options for ovarian cancer typically include surgery, chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy or targeted therapy. 
                Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial for improving outcomes and survival rates. 
                Women with a family history of ovarian cancer or other risk factors should discuss screening options with their healthcare provider.

            <p>
                Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach that plays a vital role in digestion and blood sugar regulation. 
                It is often difficult to diagnose in its early stages because symptoms may not appear until the cancer has advanced. 
                Common symptoms of pancreatic cancer include abdominal pain or discomfort, unexplained weight loss, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and changes in bowel habits. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include smoking, obesity, diabetes, family history of pancreatic cancer or certain genetic syndromes, chronic pancreatitis, and age (risk increases with age). 
                Treatment options for pancreatic cancer depend on the stage of the disease and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. 
                Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial for improving outcomes and survival rates in pancreatic cancer

            <h2  text-align: center >Thyroid Cancer</h2>
            <p>
                Thyroid cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped organ located at the base of the neck. 
                The thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate metabolism and other essential bodily functions. 
                Thyroid cancer is often detected early and has a high survival rate. 
                Common symptoms of thyroid cancer include a lump or swelling in the neck, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, neck pain, and enlarged lymph nodes. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
                Risk factors for thyroid cancer include radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer or certain genetic syndromes, and being female. 
                Treatment options for thyroid cancer depend on the type and stage of cancer and may include surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, thyroid hormone therapy, external beam radiation therapy, or targeted therapy. 
                The prognosis for thyroid cancer is generally favorable, especially when diagnosed and treated early. 
                Regular check-ups and monitoring are important for individuals at risk of thyroid cancer or those with a family history of the disease.
